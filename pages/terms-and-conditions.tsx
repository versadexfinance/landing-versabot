          issues, losses, or disputes arising from your relationship with your
          non-custodial wallet provider. Any problems or claims related to the

        <p>
          2.2.1 VersaBot includes a fiat on-ramp feature, enabling users to
          convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency. The fiat on-ramp service is
          provided by a third party. VersaBot is not responsible for any issues,
          liabilities, or obligations arising from the use of the fiat on-ramp
          service. All responsibilities and risks associated with the fiat

          facilitates transactions in the user&rsquo;s preferred language. Users
          can input simple instructions to trigger transactions through VersaAI.

          held responsible. It is your sole responsibility to review and verify
          the accuracy of all instructions before submission. VersaBot disclaims
